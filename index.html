            <h2>A Passion for Saving Lives</h2>

            <p>
        Based in Las Vegas, Nevada, the primary goal of PAWsitive Difference is to rescue, foster, and find furever homes for homeless dogs in need.  We rescue many dogs that have been abandoned or are on the kill list at our local animal foundation and we match these dogs with their purrfect loving families. We provide training classes and unlimited support upon adoption to ensure the safety and happiness of the dogs and the families.
        </p> 

        <p>
            Additionally, we help support Veterans and senior citizens in keeping their dogs by providing assistance with the costs of feeding, grooming, medication/shots, and veterinary care. Many of the services we provide are very expensive and our dogs are supported entirely through monetary donations made by people in our community.
        </p>
 

        <p>
            Our founder started rescuing as many dogs as she could on her own. Over the years many people have joined her cause. Today we have a dedicated team of volunteers and fosters so we can save a lot more dogs!
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2024 we helped 965 dogs and 134 cats, in 2025 our wish is to help even more! Please help us care for these animals by donating funds through the Donate link found at the top of this page.
        </p>


        
            <h2>Our Founders</h2>
            <p>
        Annette Thomas (founder) is a hair stylist and an animal lover. She has worked tirelessly on her own for more than 22 years re-homing and rehabilitating thousands of animals. She has helped rescue, save, foster, adopt, rehab, match and/or provide hospice for these dogs from her strong passion and love for dogs and animals.
        </p>

        <p>
            Margaret Deibert (co-founder) is an accountant and she recommended that Annette become a 501(c)(3) and she did the required paperwork and in July of 2015, PAWsitive Difference Pet Rescue was born.
